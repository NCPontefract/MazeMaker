# MazeMaker
An implementation of depth-first search and recursive backtracking using JavaScript.
Generates a maze.
By default uses an aspect ratio of 16:9 -- the best aspect ratio.

The idea for this was taken from Dan Shiffman's videos, and the method for implementation of the algorithm was taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm.
